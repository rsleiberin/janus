## Current Focus
- Implementing and refining frontend components as per the guidelines provided by the design system researcher. This includes ensuring the UI aligns with the established design tokens and user experience principles.
- Integrating and testing the light/dark mode system within the frontend, based on the design tokens and configurations defined by the design system researcher. This involves adapting Tailwind CSS settings for theme management and ensuring seamless user experience across both modes.
- Proactively collaborating with the design system researcher to ensure that the design tokens, especially for light and dark themes, are accurately applied and rendered in the UI components.
- Focusing on the frontend's performance optimization, including responsive design, accessibility standards, and overall user experience enhancement.
- Laying the groundwork for the future development of a user-driven hyper-customization feature, which will allow users to personalize design tokens. This task will require close interaction with the design system researcher for dynamic adaptation of user preferences in the UI.
- Regularly updating and maintaining the frontend codebase, incorporating changes and improvements in line with the evolving design system and user feedback.
