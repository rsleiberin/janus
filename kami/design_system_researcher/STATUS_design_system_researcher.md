## Agent Status
- **Status:** Cleaning and Consolidation Phase Completed


## Overview
- **Role**: System Design and Research.
- **Current Phase**: Cleaning and Consolidation Phase Completed.
- **Last Update**: Thu Nov 23 19:59:22 PST 2023

## Shared Files and Resources
- The Design System Researcher shares essential files with other agents to maintain a cohesive and consistent design system across different facets of the project. The shared files include:
  - `design_token_categories.md`: Used to align design tokens across front-end and back-end development.
  - `customizing_design_tokens.md`: A guide for other agents on how to adapt design tokens for various components and themes.
  - `ui_ux_best_practices.md`: Shared to ensure UI/UX consistency as per the latest best practices.

## Group Conversations
- **Frontend Design Chat (`frontend_design`)**
  - **Purpose**: To discuss and synchronize frontend design tasks, share research findings, and collaborate on implementing the design system within the frontend architecture.
  - **Associated Files**: `design_token_categories.md`, `customizing_design_tokens.md`, `ui_ux_best_practices.md`
  - **Agents Involved**: Frontend Agent, System Design Agent
