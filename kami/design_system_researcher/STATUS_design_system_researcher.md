## Current Focus
- Assisting in the development of the frontend by providing guidelines and resources on design tokens, ensuring their consistent application across the frontend developed by the frontend agent.
- Defining and refining the design tokens for both light and dark modes, to be utilized by the frontend agent for implementing a flexible theme system.
- Collaborating with the frontend agent to ensure a cohesive implementation of the design system, particularly focusing on the integration of light/dark mode capabilities.
- Preparing for the future enhancement of the design system to support a hyper-customization feature, which will enable users to personalize design tokens based on their preferences. This involves conceptual planning and establishing guidelines for dynamic customization capabilities.
- Continuously researching and updating the design system to align with current best practices in UI/UX design, and ensuring these updates are communicated to the frontend agent for implementation.
