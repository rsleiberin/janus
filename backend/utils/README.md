# Utils Directory

## Overview
This directory contains utility scripts for the Janus backend. These utilities provide core functionalities such as file handling, logging configuration, error handling, and security features. The directory is designed for modularity and scalability, ensuring that utility functions are reusable and easy to integrate across the backend.

The current focus is on refactoring and enhancing the `logger.py` module to adhere to best practices and support the backend's agentic framework.

## Logger Module (`logger.py`)

### Overview
The `logger.py` module provides centralized logging functionality for the backend, supporting both console and database logging. It ensures all logs are consistent, structured, and enriched with contextual metadata.

### Key Features
- **Console Logging**: Logs messages to the console with optional metadata.
- **Database Logging**: Stores logs in the database for searchability and auditing.
- **Structured Format**: Formats logs in a machine-readable JSON structure.
- **Extensibility**: Prepared for integration with real-time monitoring tools.

## Current Work: Logger Refactor

### **Why Refactor the Logger?**
The existing `logger.py` implementation is functional but does not adhere to best practices for scalability or centralized logging. The backend relies on logging as a primary source of truth for both debugging and real-time system monitoring. By enhancing the logger:
1. We ensure all logs are consistent, structured, and searchable.
2. We provide a unified interface for logging across the application.
3. We enable future expansion, such as integrating remote logging services or monitoring dashboards.

### **Goals of the Refactor**
1. Centralize logging to ensure consistency across all backend modules.
2. Store logs in the database to facilitate granular auditing and searchability.
3. Implement log levels and metadata for context-rich logging (e.g., module, user ID, and timestamp).
4. Unify logs to support both agents and human users with a machine-parsable yet human-readable format.
5. Ensure compatibility with real-time log monitoring in future development phases.

## Steps in Progress
1. **Enhancing Logger Functionality**:
   - Add methods for database integration.
   - Implement granular metadata support.
   - Standardize log formats across the backend.

2. **Updating Dependencies**:
   - Audit files currently using Python's built-in logging module.
   - Replace standard `logging` imports with the centralized `logger.py` module.

3. **Database Model Updates**:
   - Update the `Log` model to include fields for user ID, module name, timestamp, log level, and message content.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all new functionality in `logger.py`.
   - Write integration tests to verify logs are correctly stored in the database.
   - Test edge cases, concurrency, and performance benchmarks for logging.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update this README with finalized usage instructions for the logger.
   - Document the centralized logging design in the main project README.

6. **Integration**:
   - Ensure all modules in `db/`, `routes/`, `utils/`, and `extensions/` are integrated with `logger.py`.
