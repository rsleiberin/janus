# Backend Tests

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Janus backend, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the API, database, and other backend components.

---

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (e.g., functions, routes) in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the interaction between multiple components (e.g., API + database).
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real-world user workflows across the entire backend system.

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip.
2. Install additional testing dependencies: pytest and pytest-flask.

### Running All Tests
Run `pytest` from the project root to execute all test cases.

### Running Specific Test Files
Provide the path to the specific test file, for example: `pytest backend/tests/test_status_routes.py`.

### Running Specific Test Functions
Use the `::` syntax to run a specific test function, for example: `pytest backend/tests/test_status_routes.py::test_status_route`.

## Testing Organization

### Test Files
Test files are located in the `backend/tests/` directory and follow the naming convention `test_<module_name>.py`. Current test files:
- **test_file_routes.py**: Tests for file-related routes **[âœ… Completed | Ticket #30]**
- **test_status_routes.py**: Tests for status-related routes **[âœ… Completed | Ticket #31]**
- **test_image_routes.py**: Tests for image-related routes **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #34]**
- **test_utils.py**: Tests for utility functions **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #33]**
- **test_db_helpers.py**: Tests for database helper functions **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #13]**
- **test_seed_data.py**: Tests for database seeding **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #14]**

### Test Fixtures
Common setup and teardown logic is defined in `conftest.py`. Key fixtures include:
- **client**: A Flask test client for simulating API requests.
- **setup_and_teardown_db**: Handles database setup and cleanup for each test session.

## Test Coverage

### Current Coverage
- **Routes**:
  - Status routes: Health check endpoint **[âœ… Completed | Ticket #6]**
  - File routes: File listing and content retrieval **[âœ… Completed | Ticket #7]**
  - Image routes: Placeholder for image-related routes **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #34]**
- **Database**:
  - Database schema validation **[âœ… Completed | Ticket #10]**
  - Data seeding and helper operations **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #13, Ticket #14]**
- **Utilities**:
  - File handler utilities **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #30]**
  - Logging configuration tests **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #31]**

### Future Coverage Goals
- Authentication and security testing **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #32]**
- Data analytics and machine learning workflow validation **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #33]**
- Admin and user management endpoints **[ðŸš§ In Progress | Ticket #11]**

## Debugging Tips

1. **Run with Verbose Output**:
   Use the `-s` flag with pytest to display print statements and logs during the test run.

2. **Check Python Path**:
   Ensure that all required directories are added to the Python path to resolve imports properly.

3. **Database Issues**:
   - Ensure the database schema is initialized before running tests.
   - If issues persist, delete the database file and recreate it.

## Example Test Output
Tests should produce output similar to the following:

Test session starts, with the platform and pytest version information. The test results are listed, showing passed or failed tests, and a summary with the total time taken.
