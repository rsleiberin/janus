# Backend Directory

## Overview
This directory contains the Flask backend for the Janus project, responsible for handling API requests, database operations, and backend logic. It integrates seamlessly with the `image_processing` module and the Next.js frontend. The backend is designed to be modular, scalable, and ready for future extensions.

---

## Goals

### Current Goals (MVP)
1. Provide a modular structure for handling API routes and database operations.
2. Facilitate interaction between the frontend and backend via RESTful API endpoints.
3. Enable integration with `image_processing` scripts for metadata extraction and analysis.

### Future Goals (Post-MVP)
1. Add API authentication and security mechanisms.
2. Integrate advanced features like machine learning and data analytics.
3. Scale database operations to handle larger datasets and real-time queries.
4. Support admin and user-specific functionalities.

## Phases and Rationale

### **Phase 1: Business Logic (Current Phase)**
- Focus on proof-of-concept API endpoints and database integration.
- Files In Progress: `app.py`, `config.py`, `models.py`, `image_routes.py`, `status_routes.py`.

### **Phase 2: Research and User Features**
- Expand database capabilities and introduce user management.
- Files Pending: `user_routes.py`, `security.py`, `db_helpers.py`, `seed_data.py`.

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration**
- Connect the backend with the Next.js frontend and support rendered views.
- Files Pending: `templates/`, `static/`, `admin_routes.py`.

### **Phase 4: Extensions**
- Add advanced features like ML, analytics, and third-party integrations.
- Files Pending: `machine_learning.py`, `data_analytics.py`, `integrations.py`, `openapi_spec.yaml`, `api_auth.py`, `api_throttling.py`.

## GitHub Workflow
1. Use feature branches for new functionality (e.g., `feature/api-upload`).
2. Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions and link them to relevant issues.
3. Ensure all tests pass before merging into the `main` branch.
