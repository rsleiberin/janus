# Routes Directory

## Overview
This directory contains modularized Flask routes for the Janus backend. Each file handles a specific domain of API functionality, with standardized logging, error handling, and input validation integrated.

## Walkthrough of Routes

### **status_routes.py**
**Endpoints**:
- `/status` (GET): Returns a "healthy" status message for system monitoring.

### **file_routes.py**
**Endpoints**:
- `/upload` (POST): Handles file uploads, saving metadata to the database.  
- `/files/<file_id>` (GET): Retrieves information about a specific file.  
- `/files` (GET): Lists all uploaded files and their metadata.

### **authentication_routes.py**
**Endpoints**:
- `/auth/register` (POST): Allows users to register with a username, email, password, and role.  
- `/auth/login` (POST): Authenticates users and generates JWT access tokens.  
- `/auth/profile` (GET): Retrieves user profile information for authenticated users.

## Best Practices
1. **Standardized Logging**: Use the `CentralizedLogger` for all logs in routes.  
2. **Error Handling**: Wrap route logic with error-handling utilities to ensure consistent responses and debugging.  
3. **Input Validation**: Validate inputs at the route level using `security.py` or other utility functions.  
4. **Modularity**: Keep routes focused on a single domain of functionality and delegate shared tasks to utilities or database helpers.  
5. **Testing**: Write test cases for all routes in the `tests/routes/` directory, ensuring both success and failure paths are covered.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate `image_routes.py`, `user_routes.py`, and `admin_routes.py` as the backend expands.  
- Add OpenAPI documentation for all routes.  
- Implement rate limiting and API key-based access control.
