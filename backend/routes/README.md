# Routes Directory

## Overview
This directory contains modularized Flask routes for the backend. Each file corresponds to a specific set of API endpoints, categorized by functionality.

## Directory Structure with Implementation Stages

### **routes/**
- **image_routes.py**: API routes for image-related operations **[❌ Pending]**
- **status_routes.py**: General routes for health checks and status updates **[✅ Completed]**
- **README.md**: Documents each route and its purpose **[✅ Completed]**

## Walkthrough of Routes

### **image_routes.py**
**Endpoints**:

## How to Contribute
1. Add new routes to the appropriate file (e.g., image-related routes to `image_routes.py`).
2. Document each new route in this README with:
   - Endpoint URL
   - HTTP method
   - Expected inputs/outputs
3. Write test cases for all new routes in the `tests/` directory.

## Best Practices
1. Keep routes modular and focused on a single domain of functionality.
2. Use descriptive names for endpoint functions and routes.
3. Validate all inputs to prevent errors or misuse.
