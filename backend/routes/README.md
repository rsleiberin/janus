# Routes Directory

## Overview
This directory contains modularized Flask routes for the Janus backend. Each file handles a specific domain of API functionality, with standardized logging, error handling, and input validation integrated.

## Directory Structure with Status

**routes/**
- **README.md** [‚úÖ Completed]  
  Documentation for the directory and its routes.
- **\_\_init\_\_.py** [‚úÖ Completed]  
  Initializes the `routes` module.
- **status_routes.py** [üöß In Progress | #71, #72, #73]  
  General routes for health checks and system status.
- **file_routes.py** [üöß In Progress | #71, #72, #73]  
  Routes for handling file uploads and management.
- **image_routes.py** [‚ùå Pending | Phase 3]  
  Handles image-related API operations.
- **user_routes.py** [‚ùå Pending | Phase 3]  
  Manages user-related functionality (e.g., authentication, profile updates).
- **admin_routes.py** [‚ùå Pending | Phase 3]  
  Administrative routes for managing users, logs, and other data.
- **files/** [‚Ü∫ Managed]  
  Placeholder for file-related assets or configurations.

## Walkthrough of Routes

### **status_routes.py**
**Endpoints**:
- `/status` (GET): Returns a "healthy" status message for system monitoring.  

### **file_routes.py**
**Endpoints**:
- `/upload` (POST): Handles file uploads, saving metadata to the database.  
- `/files/<file_id>` (GET): Retrieves information about a specific file.  
- `/files` (GET): Lists all uploaded files and their metadata.

## Best Practices
1. **Standardized Logging**: Use the `CentralizedLogger` for all logs in routes.  
2. **Error Handling**: Wrap route logic with error-handling utilities to ensure consistent responses and debugging.  
3. **Input Validation**: Validate inputs at the route level using `security.py` or other utility functions.  
4. **Modularity**: Keep routes focused on a single domain of functionality and delegate shared tasks to utilities or database helpers.  
5. **Testing**: Write test cases for all routes in the `tests/routes/` directory, ensuring both success and failure paths are covered.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate `image_routes.py`, `user_routes.py`, and `admin_routes.py` as the backend expands.  
- Add support for API authentication and authorization.  
- Provide OpenAPI documentation for all routes.
