# **Updated `backend/routes/README.md`**

## Purpose

The `routes/` directory is the backbone of the Janus backend, defining all **API endpoints** for front-end or external clients to communicate with the system. Each route file focuses on a **specific domain** (e.g., users, administration, analytics), promoting a **clear separation of concerns** and ensuring easier maintenance and scalability.

---

## Overview

By splitting routes into modules (e.g., `admin_routes.py`, `user_routes.py`), the application achieves:

- **Modularity**: Individual route files can evolve independently without colliding with unrelated features.  
- **Consistency**: Centralized error handling, logging, and validations in each module reduce duplicated logic.  
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication is integrated through decorators (e.g., `@jwt_required()`), ensuring routes can be locked down.  

Combined with database helpers (`backend/db/helpers`), these routes maintain a **clean boundary** between the **web layer** and the **data layer**.

---

## Phases (Project Roadmap)

**Phase 1 (MVP Completed)**  
- Implemented essential routes: authentication, user management, security, logs, image uploads, etc.  
- Achieved a minimal but functional API with robust error handling and JWT-based authentication.

**Phase 2 (Planned)**  
- Further integration of **image analysis** endpoints (`image_analysis_routes.py`).  
- Additional route expansions to support advanced analytics or cross-model queries.

**Phase 3 (Frontend Integration)**  
- Connect with the Next.js frontend for real-time image updates, design token generation, or SSR templates if needed.  
- Possibly implement GraphQL or additional REST endpoints to facilitate dynamic UI/UX features.

**Phase 4 (Scalability & Specialized Integrations)**  
- Migrate from SQLite to a more scalable RDBMS (PostgreSQL or MySQL) if usage demands.  
- Add advanced security measures, performance optimizations, or ML integrations based on user feedback.

## Directory Structure

routes/  
• **`README.md`** – High-level documentation of route modules and purpose.  
• **`__init__.py`** – Central `register_blueprints` function that imports and registers each blueprint.  
• **`admin_routes.py`** – Administrative endpoints (listing users, fetching logs, deleting users).  
• **`analytics_routes.py`** – Endpoints for creating/fetching/deleting analytics records.  
• **`authentication_routes.py`** – User registration, login, and profile routes.  
• **`error_and_health_monitoring_routes.py`** – Health checks and simulated error endpoints for monitoring/testing.  
• **`file_routes.py`** – Simple file listing/reading endpoints for demonstration or local file inspection.  
• **`image_analysis_routes.py`** – *(Pending/Placeholder)* for advanced image analysis tasks.  
• **`image_routes.py`** – Image upload, retrieval, and deletion endpoints.  
• **`log_routes.py`** – Simple log retrieval endpoints, demonstrating how logs can be exposed or filtered.  
• **`security_routes.py`** – Extra security flows (login, logout, refresh, password resets).  
• **`status_routes.py`** – Basic system status and database health checks.  
• **`user_routes.py`** – Common user profile endpoints (fetch/update current user’s data).

## Best Practices

1. **Blueprint Organization**  
   Each Python file defines one Flask `Blueprint`, focusing on a single domain (e.g., `admin_bp`, `user_bp`). This makes route registration modular.

2. **Centralized Error Handling**  
   Use the error-handling utilities in `backend/utils/error_handling/` to ensure consistent JSON responses and logs across modules.

3. **JWT Protection**  
   Decorate routes with `@jwt_required()` to ensure only authenticated (and possibly authorized) users can access them. Integrate role or permission checks if needed.

4. **Logging**  
   Every route logs crucial info (e.g., user actions, error traces) through a **`CentralizedLogger`** instance, simplifying audits and debugging.

5. **Database Helpers**  
   Route handlers should avoid complex SQL logic; instead, delegate to `backend/db/helpers/` for CRUD operations. This keeps code more readable and testable.

6. **Extensibility**  
   Add or remove entire route files (e.g., `analytics_routes.py`) without impacting unrelated features. Migrations and seed data in `backend/db/` handle schema changes.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Add a Route File**  
   Create `something_routes.py` with a new `Blueprint`.  
   Implement endpoints referencing `backend.db.helpers` or direct model queries.  
   Import and register the blueprint in `backend/routes/__init__.py`.

2. **Protect Endpoints**  
   Use `@jwt_required()` for routes needing authentication.  
   If advanced roles are needed, a role check can occur after retrieving `get_jwt_identity()`.

3. **Error Handling**  
   Wrap risky operations in `try/except` blocks, calling shared utilities (e.g., `handle_general_error`) to return a standardized error response.

4. **Logging**  
   Use `logger.log_to_console(...)` or `logger.log_to_db(...)` for key actions (file uploads, user deletions, etc.).  
   This ensures a consistent log trail across the entire application.

---

## Future Plans

1. **Advanced Image Analysis**  
   A dedicated route file (`image_analysis_routes.py`) is pending to handle advanced operations on images or design tokens.

2. **SSR or SPA Integration**  
   If needed, incorporate route logic that renders server-side templates or serves static assets from `backend/templates` and `backend/static`.

3. **Enhanced Security**  
   Optional expansions like multi-factor authentication, IP-based rate limiting, or granular permissions can augment the `security_routes.py`.

4. **Performance Scaling**  
   If user traffic grows, routes can be optimized or deployed across multiple workers using WSGI servers like Gunicorn or a Docker-based microservices approach.

## Conclusion

A clear, **domain-based** route structure ensures the Janus backend remains **understandable** and **extensible**. Whether adding new image-processing flows, advanced analytics, or novel administrative endpoints, this layout promotes minimal friction and maximum clarity for future contributors.
