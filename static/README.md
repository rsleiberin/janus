# Static Directory

## Introduction
The `static` directory is reserved for hosting static assets crucial to the Janus Flask Project. It includes images, CSS files, JavaScript, and other resources that will be served directly to the client without additional processing by the Flask server. As the frontend is built using Next.js, most of the styling and interactivity assets will be managed there. However, this directory ensures that any backend-specific or shared assets remain accessible and organized.

## Status
- `Currently Empty`

## Tasks
- [ ] Populate with necessary static assets like branding images, icons, and other visual elements that support the user's personal brand and the visual animations they create.
- [ ] Consider integrating compression tools or optimization methods to enhance the web performance for larger static files.
- [ ] Establish naming conventions and folder structures to manage diverse styles and themes cohesively, ensuring the assets are easily retrievable.

## Files
- Currently, there are no files in this directory.

## Directories
- This directory does not contain any sub-directories. In the future, consider organizing assets into sub-categories like `images`, `css`, and `js` to maintain clarity as the project scales.
