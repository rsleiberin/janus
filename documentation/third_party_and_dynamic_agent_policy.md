# Third-Party and Dynamic Agent Policy

This document outlines the policies for integrating third-party agents and dynamically selecting agents based on data sensitivity and funding limitations within the system.

## Integration of Third-Party Agents

- **Security and Compliance**: Prior to integration, third-party agents must be vetted for security compliance and data handling practices.
- **Data Privacy**: A localized agent will review data intended for third-party agents to ensure no sensitive information is transmitted outside the system.
- **Service Agreements**: Service level agreements (SLAs) must be in place, detailing the expected performance and reliability of third-party agents.

## Dynamic Agent Selection

- **Model Appropriateness**: The system will dynamically select the most appropriate model for a task, considering the nature of the action and the sensitivity of the data involved.
- **Funding Limitations**: The agent constructor will take into account the available budget when allocating tasks to either OpenAI or third-party agents.
- **Approval Process**: All model atoms and actions must go through an approval process to ensure they are suitable for use with the given constraints.

## Sensitivity Checkpoint

- **Local Sensitivity Agent**: A dedicated local agent will be responsible for checking data against a sensitivity index before allowing it to be processed by any external agents.
- **Redaction and Anonymization**: If sensitive data is detected, the agent will either redact the information or anonymize it to maintain privacy.

## Funding and Cost Management

- **Budget Tracking**: Each sub-agent will have access to a budget tracker to monitor and control spending on third-party services.
- **Cost-Efficient Operations**: The system will prioritize operations that optimize costs without compromising on the quality of the output.

## Policy Enforcement

- **Regular Audits**: The use of third-party agents and the dynamic agent selection process will be audited regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect the evolving landscape of AI services and financial considerations.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that the system remains secure, efficient, and cost-effective while leveraging the capabilities of third-party agents.
