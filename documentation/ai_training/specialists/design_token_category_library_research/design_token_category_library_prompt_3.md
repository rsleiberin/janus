# Specialist Instructions for Backend and Frontend Research

## Objective
The aim is to extend our design token system to include specific guidelines and examples on how these tokens will be utilized in the backend (Flask) and frontend (Next.js) parts of our web application. This will ensure that our design system is fully integrated across the entire stack.

## Backend Research (`backend_specific.md`)
- Investigate how design tokens can be integrated into Flask to serve dynamic and personalized content.
- Document how to manage design tokens within Python code and Flask templates.
- Explore how Flask can use design tokens to influence server-side rendered pages or API responses that the frontend can consume.

## Frontend Research (`frontend_specific.md`)
- Study the application of design tokens in a Next.js environment, specifically with the usage of Tailwind CSS for styling components.
- Provide examples showcasing the transformation of design tokens into functional Tailwind CSS classes within React components.
- Look into strategies for incorporating dynamic theming based on user preferences or system settings within Next.js.

## Deliverables
Two structured markdown files, `backend_specific.md` and `frontend_specific.md`, should be compiled with the research findings. These documents will provide clear directives on applying design tokens into our web application's development.

## Progress Updates
Please share the status of your research periodically. Upon completion of each document, confirm the containment of all pertinent information and examples to demonstrate the application of our design system within Flask and Next.js frameworks.
