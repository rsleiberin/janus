## Flask Web Development Trends in 2023

### Microservices and Serverless Platforms
Flask's rise in popularity suggests a shift towards smaller frameworks, favoring microservices and serverless architectures. This aligns with the industry's push for modular, scalable, and efficient development practices, impacting how we design and manage design tokens within applications.
