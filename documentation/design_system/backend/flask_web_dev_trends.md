## Flask Web Development Trends in 2023

Flask's adaptability and ease of integration make it well-suited to staying current with web development trends. This document covers how these trends may affect our approach to design tokens and overall application architecture.

### Microservices and Serverless Platforms
The industry is moving towards modular, scalable, and serverless solutions. Flask's flexibility makes it an excellent choice for these architectures, which necessitates a dynamic and resilient approach to managing design tokens.
