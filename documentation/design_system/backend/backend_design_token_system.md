# Design Token System in Flask

## Introduction
This document outlines best practices for managing and serving design tokens within a Flask application, focusing on its role as a backend service for a Next.js frontend.

## Serving Design Tokens via Flask Routes
Flask can efficiently serve design tokens to the frontend, providing a dynamic and adaptable way to manage UI constants.

### Flask API for Design Tokens
Create Flask routes to serve design tokens, allowing the frontend to fetch them as needed.

\```python
@app.route('/design-tokens/colors')
def color_tokens():
    colors = {
        "primary": "#005f73",
        "secondary": "#0a9396",
        "tertiary": "#94d2bd",
        // Additional colors...
    }
    return jsonify(colors)
\```

## Simplified Backend Role
Focus on the backend's role in providing data and logic, minimizing its involvement in direct UI rendering.

### Dynamic Updates to Design Tokens
Use API endpoints to introduce changes in design tokens, enabling dynamic updates on the client-side.

\```python
@app.route('/api/update_design_tokens', methods=['POST'])
def update_design_tokens():
    // Logic to update tokens
    return jsonify(success=True)
\```

## Streamlining Flask's Role in UI Design
Keep Flask's involvement in UI design to the essentials, ensuring clear separation of concerns and optimal performance.

### Best Practices for Flask's Involvement
- Use Flask to serve dynamic data, including design tokens, to the frontend.
- Avoid direct manipulation of UI components in Flask; delegate this to the frontend.
- Streamline communication between backend and frontend, focusing on efficiency and clarity.

## Conclusion
Flask's streamlined role in serving design tokens ensures a clear separation between backend logic and frontend presentation, aligning with modern web application architectures.
