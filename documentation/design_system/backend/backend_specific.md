# Flask-Specific Configurations for Design Token System

## Introduction
This document outlines Flask-specific configurations and best practices for serving design tokens to a Next.js frontend.

## API Endpoint Configuration

### Creating Efficient Routes
Optimize Flask routes for serving design tokens to the frontend.

\```python
@app.route('/api/design-tokens')
def get_design_tokens():
    # Logic to fetch and serve design tokens
    return jsonify(designTokens)
\```

## Flask Application Structure

### Organizing Flask App for Design Token Delivery
- Use Blueprints for modularizing design token functionality.
- Structure the application for quick updates to design tokens.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
Implement caching for frequently requested design tokens to reduce load times.

### Load Balancing
Consider load balancing for handling increased traffic and data requests.

## Security Considerations

### Secure Data Transmission
- Ensure the use of HTTPS for API endpoints.
- Implement necessary authentication and authorization.

## Flask Best Practices

### Consistent API Design
- Maintain API consistency for frontend ease of use.
- Follow RESTful principles for API endpoint structure.

### Testing and Documentation
- Conduct thorough tests on endpoints serving design tokens.
- Provide clear frontend developer documentation.
