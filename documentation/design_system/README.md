# Design System Documentation

Welcome to the design system documentation directory. This location contains categorically sorted documents that form the backbone of our web application's design system.

## Overview
This directory houses the comprehensive design tokens used across our web application. It serves as the foundation of our design language, ensuring visual cohesion and flexibility.

## Key Documents
- `design_tokens.md`: Contains the detailed library of design tokens.


## Subdirectories and Their Purposes

### Backend
- `backend/`: Focuses on design principles and token documentation specific to the backend system structure and frameworks (Flask).
### Best Practices
- `best_practicies/`: Houses the collection of documents detailing UI/UX best practices that guide the design decisions across the application.
### Frontend
- `frontend/`: Contains design guidelines, tokens and other critical design documents pertaining to the frontend of the application (Next.js).
### Visual Assets
- The `visual-assets` subdirectory includes all graphical elements that illustrate our design tokens in action.

This structure is intended to support a modular, adaptable, and scalable design system that can evolve with the needs of the project.
