# Backend and Frontend Design Token Integration Research

## Backend Research: Flask (`backend_specific.md`)

### Topics of Investigation:
- Utilization of design tokens within Flask's server-side rendering mechanism.
- Strategies for embedding design tokens into Python code and Flask templates for dynamic UI generation.
- Methods for Flask to provide design tokens via API endpoints, facilitating responsive design changes on the client side.

## Frontend Research: Next.js with Tailwind CSS (`frontend_specific.md`)

### Topics of Investigation:
- Translation of the design tokens into functional Tailwind CSS classes within Next.jsâ€™ React component architecture.
- Techniques for implementing design tokens in Next.js for static and server-side rendering scenarios.
- Dynamic theming adaptation in Next.js, based on user preferences or system settings, leveraging React's Context API or similar state management tools.

## Deliverables:
- Two separate markdown documents, `backend_specific.md` and `frontend_specific.md`, detailing the implementation use-cases of design tokens.
- Practical code examples and guidelines to be included within both documents, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of the design token system within our full-stack environment.

## Progression Timeline:
- Commence initial research on Flask backend implementation methods for design tokens.
- Upon completion, pivot towards the research for Next.js frontend applications, paying close attention to the integration with Tailwind CSS.
- Regular updates to be provided at crucial milestones or upon completion of significant sections of research.

## Conclusion:
The generated documentation will drive the practical application and ensure seamless integration of the design system, thus facilitating a cohesive backend-frontend dynamic within our web application's architectural framework.
