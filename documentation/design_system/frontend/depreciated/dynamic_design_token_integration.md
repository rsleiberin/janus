# Dynamically Updating Tailwind CSS with Design Tokens in Next.js

To keep the UI consistent and adaptable, we dynamically update Tailwind CSS with design tokens using a combination of Style Dictionary and the `next-themes` library.

## Synchronizing Design Tokens with Tailwind

We start by structuring our project to include a Style Dictionary setup, which will transform design tokens into CSS variables and themes:

\```plaintext
// Project structure
src
├── styles
│   ├── tokens
│   │   ├── global.json
│   │   ├── dark.json
│   │   ├── light.json
│   ├── build.js
\```

When design changes are pushed from Figma, a pipeline is triggered to transform these raw data into CSS variables, ensuring that the latest design decisions are reflected in the code:

\```bash
// In package.json scripts
"transform-tokens": "node src/styles/script/build.js"
\```

## Style Dictionary Transformations

Style Dictionary is configured to process the token files, performing necessary transformations to fit Tailwind's format:

\```javascript
// In build.js using Style Dictionary
StyleDictionaryPackage.registerTransform({
  name: 'size/letterspacing',
  transformer: (token) => transformLetterSpacing(token.value)
});
\```
(Source: [DEV Community](https://dev.to/ainatenhi/syncing-design-tokens-with-tailwind-css-theme-4d4d))

Box shadows and other complex styles are also converted into CSS variables using Style Dictionary:

\```javascript
// Transform function for box-shadows
StyleDictionaryPackage.registerTransform({
  name: "shadow/css",
  transformer: (token) => { /* ... */ },
});
\```
(Source: [DEV Community](https://dev.to/ainatenhi/syncing-design-tokens-with-tailwind-css-theme-4d4d))

Finally, the build process generates CSS files with these variables, which are then utilized by Tailwind:

\```javascript
// In build.js defining Style Dictionary's file output
files: [{
  destination: `${theme}.css`,
  format: 'css/variables',
  selector: `:root.${theme}`
}]
\```
(Source: [DEV Community](https://dev.to/ainatenhi/syncing-design-tokens-with-tailwind-css-theme-4d4d))

The Tailwind configuration is updated to reflect these new design tokens, allowing for dynamic theme switching and token application:

\```javascript
// In tailwind.config.js
theme: {
  // Theme configuration using generated CSS variables
}
\```
(Source: [DEV Community](https://dev.to/ainatenhi/syncing-design-tokens-with-tailwind-css-theme-4d4d))

This process ensures that design tokens are dynamically reflected in the styling of the application, allowing for a seamless transition between different themes and the adaptation of new design decisions.
