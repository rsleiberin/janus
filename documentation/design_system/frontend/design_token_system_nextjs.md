# Design Token System in Next.js

## Introduction
This guide provides a complete overview of the design token system within a Next.js environment, detailing how tokens are managed, integrated, and synchronized with backend services.

## Defining and Storing Design Tokens
Design tokens are defined in a centralized JSON file, which serves as the single source of truth for UI constants used across the application.

\`\`\`json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#007ace",
    "secondary": "#f3f4f6"
  },
  "spacing": {
    "small": "0.5rem",
    "medium": "1rem",
    "large": "2rem"
  }
  // Additional tokens...
}
\`\`\`

## Integrating Design Tokens with Tailwind CSS
Tailwind's configuration is extended to incorporate the design tokens, allowing you to use them as utility classes throughout the application.

\`\`\`javascript
// tailwind.config.js
const designTokens = require('./tokens.json');

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: designTokens.colors,
      spacing: designTokens.spacing
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Synchronizing Tokens with the Flask Backend
A Flask API endpoint serves the latest design tokens which are fetched in the Next.js application using a custom hook.

\`\`\`python
# Flask endpoint serving design tokens
@app.route('/api/design-tokens')
def get_design_tokens():
    # Logic to serve tokens
    return jsonify({
        "colors": {
            "primary": "#007ace",
            "secondary": "#f3f4f6"
        },
        "spacing": {
            "small": "0.5rem",
            "medium": "1rem",
            "large": "2rem"
        }
        // Additional tokens...
    })
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
// Next.js hook fetching and applying design tokens
export default function useDesignTokens() {
  // Fetch and state management logic
}
\`\`\`

## Testing and Best Practices
Unit tests ensure that the design tokens are applied correctly, and best practices such as naming conventions and regular reviews maintain the system's health.

This document serves as a roadmap for developers to implement a scalable and maintainable design token system within Next.js projects, aligned with backend services for a cohesive user experience.
