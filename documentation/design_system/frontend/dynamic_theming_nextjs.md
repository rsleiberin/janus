# Dynamic Theming in Next.js

## Introduction
This document outlines the process of implementing dynamic theming in a Next.js application with Tailwind CSS, allowing users to select their preferred theme dynamically.

## Installation and Configuration
The `next-themes` package aids in managing theme state within the application.

\`\`\`bash
npm install next-themes
\`\`\`

Configure the `ThemeProvider` to enable dynamic theme switching.

\`\`\`tsx
// /app/provider.tsx
import { ThemeProvider as NextThemesProvider } from "next-themes";

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  // Theme provider logic
}
\`\`\`

## Tailwind CSS Dark Mode Setup
Set up dark mode theming within Tailwind's configuration using class-based toggling.

\`\`\`js
// tailwind.config.ts
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  // Rest of the config...
};
\`\`\`

## Creating a Theme Switch Component
Develop a component that allows users to switch between themes interactively.

\`\`\`tsx
// /components/ThemeSwitch/index.tsx
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

export default function ThemeSwitcher() {
  // Theme switch logic
}
\`\`\`

By following these steps, developers can create a dynamic theming system in their Next.js applications, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and providing an enhanced user experience.
