## Customizing Design Tokens
This document guides the effective application of design tokens, enhancing the flexibility and modularity of the design system.

### Color Tokens Customization
- Adjust `base-palette`, `accent-colors`, `semantic-colors`, `gradients`, and `custom-illustrations` colors for brand consistency and visual identity.

### Typography Tokens Customization
- Customize `font-families`, `font-sizes`, `font-weights`, and `font-styles` to align with brand guidelines and enhance readability.

### Spacing Tokens Customization
- Modify `space-scale` and `space-responsive` for consistent layout and spacing across devices.

### Border and Corner Tokens Customization
- Adjust `border-width`, `border-style`, and `radius` values for diverse UI element styles.

### Elevation Tokens Customization
- Apply and adjust `shadow` and `z-index` for depth and layering in the UI.

### Motion Tokens Customization
- Tailor `duration` and `easing` tokens for smooth and engaging UI animations and transitions.

## AR/VR and 3D UI Customization
- **Hand and Gesture-Based Navigation**: Adapt gesture recognition and feedback styles for specific AR/VR interaction needs.
- **Voice-Activated UI**: Customize voice command response times and feedback for intuitive voice interactions.
- **3D UI Elements**: Adjust spatial positioning and depth perception for enhanced 3D effects.
- **Procedural UI**: Configure dynamic UI visibility for user actions and context in virtual environments.
- **Customizable UI**: Provide personalization options for UI in VR/AR settings.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Focus on simplicity to reduce clutter in AR/VR interfaces.
- **Gamification**: Integrate game-like interactions for engaging AR/VR experiences.

### Implementation Notes
- Define tokens within CSS preprocessors or styling solutions.
- Apply tokens consistently across projects for a unified design system.

By customizing these tokens, developers can create a unique, brand-aligned experience while maintaining consistency within the design system. This approach supports precise aesthetic and functional control, adaptable for both traditional and immersive AR/VR interfaces.
