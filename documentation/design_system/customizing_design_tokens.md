# Design Tokens Documentation

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the customization and implementation of design tokens. Each category is expanded upon with guidelines that allow developers and agents to apply these tokens effectively in creating a modular and flexible design system.

## Color Tokens

Customization of color tokens is critical for matching the brand's visual identity and ensuring consistency across all digital properties. Users can adjust the following color tokens to fit their brand:

- `base-palette` for backgrounds and UI components
- `accent-colors` for interactive elements
- `semantic-colors` for system feedback such as success, error, or warning messages
- `gradients` for dynamic visual effects and backgrounds
- `custom-illustrations` colors for unique brand graphics

The following CSS custom properties can be used for color customization:
\```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #hex-value; /* Replace with brand's primary color */
  --secondary-color: #hex-value; /* Replace with brand's secondary color */
  --error-color: #hex-value; /* Replace with brand's error color */
  --success-color: #hex-value; /* Replace with brand's success color */
  --gradient-start: #hex-value; /* Start color for gradients */
  --gradient-end: #hex-value; /* End color for gradients */
}
\```

## Typography Tokens

Typography impacts usability and brand perception. Customization of typography tokens includes:

- `font-families` for specifying primary and secondary typefaces
- `font-sizes` for defining hierarchy and readability
- `font-weights` for emphasizing text weight in different contexts
- `font-styles` for applying modern and clean typefaces like Roboto, Open Sans, Lato

Example of customization using CSS:
\```css
body {
  font-family: var(--primary-font);
  font-size: var(--font-size-root);
  font-style: var(--font-style-regular);
}

h1 {
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);
  font-style: var(--font-style-italic);
}
h2 {
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-medium);
}
\```

## Spacing Tokens

Consistent spacing tokens contribute to a cohesive visual language. Users should customize spacing for:

- `space-scale` for margins, paddings, and gaps between UI elements
- `space-responsive` for adapting spacing in different screen sizes

Adjustment of spacing tokens can be done through CSS like so:
\```css
.container {
  padding: var(--space-unit);
}

.card {
  margin-bottom: var(--space-scale);
}
\```

## Border and Corner Tokens

Borders and corners can define the style and feel of UI elements. Developers can customize border and corner tokens by adjusting:

- `border-width` for outer strokes
- `border-style` for visual effect
- `radius` values for corner roundness

For instance:
\```css
.button {
  border-width: var(--border-width-thin);
  border-radius: var(--radius-medium);
}
\```

## Elevation Tokens

Elevation tokens such as `shadow` and `z-index` add depth to the UI. Here's an example of how to apply and adjust elevation tokens:
\```css
.modal {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-1);
  z-index: var(--z-index-modal);
}
\```

## Motion Tokens

Motion can guide users through the interface, making it essential to customize motion tokens to suit interaction patterns. Below are tokens available for customization for animations and transitions:
- `duration` for controlling timing
- `easing` for creating smooth motion curves

Modify motion tokens as follows:
\```css
.alert {
  transition: background-color var(--duration-normal) var(--easing-ease-in-out);
}
\```

## Implementation

These guidelines facilitate the adjustment of design elements to craft unique and brand-appropriate user interfaces. For implementation and integration with codebases, developers are advised to define these tokens within their CSS preprocessor or styling solution and apply them across their project for a uniform design system.

By following these outlined customization options, developers can create a uniquely tailored experience that adheres to their branding requirements while maintaining design system consistency. This modular approach enables precise control over the aesthetic and functio

# Customizing Design Tokens for AR/VR and 3D UI

## Introduction
