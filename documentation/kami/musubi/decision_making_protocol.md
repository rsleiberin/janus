# Decision Making Protocol for [Kami Name]

When evaluating the need for a new sub-agent, consider the following:

- Task Complexity: Does the task require understanding and generating human language?
- Data Processing: Is there a significant amount of data processing that doesn't involve natural language?
- User Interaction: Will the sub-agent directly interact with users?
- Autonomy Level: Does the task require autonomous decision-making?

If most answers are 'yes', an LLM sub-agent is recommended. If 'no', consider alternative tools or sub-agents.
