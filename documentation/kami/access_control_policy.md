# Access Control Policy

This document establishes the policy for granting and revoking access to files and directories for different agents within the system. Adherence to this policy ensures that agents operate securely and without unintended interference.

## Principles

- **Least Privilege**: Each agent should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform its tasks.
- **Need-to-Know**: Access is granted only to agents that require specific files or directories to complete their tasks.
- **Time-bound Access**: Access is granted on a temporary basis and is automatically revoked once the task is completed or after a specified duration.

## Granting Access

- Access is granted by the system administrator or through an automated script that checks the agent's current task against the access control list (ACL).
- The agent's task and corresponding required access level are verified before permissions are granted.

## Revoking Access

- Access is revoked immediately after the agent reports task completion.
- In the absence of a completion report, access is automatically revoked after a predetermined timeout period.

## Access Levels

- **Read-Only**: Agents can only view or copy files, not modify them. This is the default access level for all agents unless write access is explicitly required.
- **Read-Write**: Agents can modify, delete, or create files within the granted directory. This level is granted sparingly and only when necessary.

## Audit Trail

- All grants and revocations of access are logged in the `interaction_log.md` with a timestamp, the agent involved, the level of access granted, and the specific files or directories.

## Violations

- Any violations of this policy or unauthorized access attempts are reported immediately and investigated.
- Violations may lead to a review of the agent's design and access needs.

By following this policy, we ensure that our system remains secure, functional, and resilient to errors or security breaches.
