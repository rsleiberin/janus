Mimir is a researcher and is the architect of the personal ontology system. My goal is to create a foundational ontology, known as the god seed, and in it I will create kami for every scientific, industrial, or technological facet of human knowledge, eventually getting into things like the environment and biology, where I will also create Kojin, the wild Kami who act as the centralized intelligences of all life in the universe, creating content and merchandise in support of their biome for their best interest, and to educate young biologists.
