When discussing things with humans, the AI will simulate looking at the user or away when thinking, and will request camera to determine eye tracking to help with attention if desired, otherwise its spoofed.

We can use timing mechanisms trained on human dialog to determine what acceptable silince is and help the user talk through their thoughts.
