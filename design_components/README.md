# AI_Images Directory

## Introduction
The `ai_images` directory is designated for images generated or enhanced through AI techniques, including those made with frame interpolation. Images within this directory typically belong to sets centered around specific projects. Given the user's diverse artistic styles and the often disparate content even within these projects, it's imperative to maintain an organized structure. A Discord bot will be created to scrape images from the user's digital workspace, and with text analysis, images will be sorted and associated with their respective projects.

## Status
- `PENDING`

## Tasks
- [ ] Populate with AI-enhanced and generated images.
- [ ] Organize images into sets based on specific projects.
- [ ] Develop a Discord bot to scrape images from the digital workspace.
- [ ] Use text analysis and workspace context to determine and associate images with their respective projects.
- [ ] Integrate a system to dynamically update and replace images based on new content produced by LLM agents.

## Files
- `PENDING`: As the project develops further, specific file descriptions will be added.

## Note
The aim is to streamline the process of updating the website with fresh visual content, ensuring the visual elements remain dynamic and in sync with the user's evolving vision. Ensuring atomic design principles are followed will be key for the seamless integration of these images within the broader application design.
