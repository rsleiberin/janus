# Design_Components Directory

## Introduction
The `design_components` directory houses the design elements crafted using atomic design principles. These components form the fundamental building blocks for the user interface and overall experience of the Janus Flask Project. Given the dynamic nature of the application, where content can be autonomously generated by LLM agents, these design components are crucial in ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

## Status
- `PENDING`

## Tasks
- [ ] Populate with atomic design-based components (atoms, molecules, organisms).
- [ ] Integrate a system where components can be dynamically updated or replaced based on content from LLM agents.
- [ ] Continuously refine and expand design components in alignment with UX best practices and the evolving requirements of the project.

## Files
- `PENDING`: Descriptions of specific design components will be provided as the project progresses.

## Directories
- `PENDING`: Sub-directories for atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages might be added based on the project's design structure.

## Note
To uphold a high standard of user experience and design consistency, these components must be meticulously crafted and frequently updated. They act as the interface bridge between the dynamic content generated by the LLMs and the user's interaction with the Janus Flask application.
