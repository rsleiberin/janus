# Design Token Best Practices

## Buttons
- Size: Ensure buttons are large enough for easy interaction, following guidelines like a minimum of 10mm x 10mm.
- Color: Use strong visual weight and contrast for primary actions; secondary actions should have weaker visual attraction.
- Shape: Opt for square or square with rounded corners to enhance information processing and maintain consistency.

## Colors
- Focus on an achromatic palette that highlights colorful AI-generated content.
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability and accessibility.

## Typography
- Align font choices with the project's minimalist theme.
- Implement scalable font sizing strategies for legibility.

## Spacing
- Implement a 4-point grid system for consistency and precision.

### Animations
- 3D Motion Graphics: Use realistic 3D animations to create engaging and interactive experiences.
- Hover Effects: Implement hover animations for interactive UI elements.
- Morphing: Use morphing effects for artistic transitions and increased user engagement.
- Anthropomorphic Animations: Incorporate subtle, human-like animations for immersive experiences.
- Kinetic Typography: Utilize moving text animations to captivate user attention and set the tone.

### Icons
- Simplicity: Keep icons simple and easily recognizable.
- Consistency: Ensure a cohesive visual style across all icons.
- Clarity: Icons should be unambiguous and clearly convey their purpose.
- Scalability: Design icons to be scalable across a range of sizes.
- Visual Hierarchy: Establish a clear hierarchy in icon design for user prioritization.
- Contextual Relevance: Icons should be appropriate for their usage context.

### Responsive Design
- Device Adaptability: Ensure design adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.
- Relative Length Units: Use scalable units for layout elements.
- Layout Considerations: Implement flexible grids and logical structures.
- Navigation Adaptability: Tailor navigation for ease of use on different devices.
- Responsive Images: Ensure images scale appropriately with layout changes.
- Text Readability: Maintain legible and appropriately sized text across devices.
