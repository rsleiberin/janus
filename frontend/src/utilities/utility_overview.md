# Utilities Best Practices

## Design Tokens
- **Buttons**: Ensure easy interaction with appropriately sized buttons. Use contrasting colors for primary and secondary actions, and maintain shape consistency.
- **Colors**: Focus on an achromatic palette, highlighting colorful AI-generated content. Ensure readability and accessibility through sufficient contrast.
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that align with the minimalist theme and implement scalable sizing for legibility.
- **Spacing**: Use a 4-point grid system for consistency and precision.

## Animations
- **3D Motion Graphics**: Create engaging and interactive experiences with realistic 3D animations.
- **Hover Effects**: Enhance UI interactivity with hover animations.
- **Morphing**: Use morphing effects for artistic transitions.
- **Anthropomorphic Animations**: Incorporate human-like animations for immersive experiences.
- **Kinetic Typography**: Captivate attention with moving text animations.

## Icons
- **Simplicity**: Keep icons simple and recognizable.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a cohesive visual style across all icons.
- **Clarity**: Ensure icons are unambiguous and clearly convey their purpose.
- **Scalability**: Design icons to be scalable across different sizes.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Establish clear hierarchy in icon design.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Ensure appropriate usage context for icons.

## Responsive Design
- **Device Adaptability**: Design should adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Relative Length Units**: Use scalable units for layout elements.
- **Layout Considerations**: Implement flexible grids and logical structures.
- **Navigation Adaptability**: Tailor navigation for different devices.
- **Responsive Images**: Ensure images scale with layout changes.
- **Text Readability**: Maintain legible text across devices.

## Shadow Token Design Guidelines

### Overview
Shadow tokens in a design system add depth and define elevations, enhancing the user interface's interactive and visual appeal. They are crucial for creating a sense of layering and indicating interactive elements.

### Best Practices for Shadow Tokens

#### Elevations in Design Systems
- **Elevations**: Comprise surfaces and shadows, offering depth or lift impressions.
- **Levels**: Four basic elevation levels - Sunken, Default, Raised, and Overlay.
- **Depth in Dark Themes**: Higher elevations (Raised and Overlay) paired with shadows for added depth, especially important in dark modes where shadows are less prominent.

#### Design Tokens Application
- **Surface and Shadow Pairings**: Follow recommended pairings; avoid mixing different shadow and surface elevation tokens.
- **Raised and Overlay Elevations**: Use cautiously to prevent a busy UI. Group related elements if required to overlay other UI components.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure contrast ratios meet accessibility standards in both light and dark modes.

#### General Usage
- **Visual Style Description**: Use shadow tokens to describe shadows' visual styles, ensuring consistency across technologies and platforms.
- **Properties**: Define shadows' color, blur, spread, and offsets.

### Implementation Recommendations
- Create tokens for shadow properties considering different UI elements and elevation levels.
- Utilize shadows to enhance usability and aesthetics, particularly for interactive elements like buttons and cards.
- Prioritize accessibility and visual harmony in both light and dark themes.

Incorporating these shadow token guidelines will enhance the depth, interactivity, and overall visual quality of the user interface, contributing to a consistent and accessible user experience.

## Border Token Design Guidelines

### Overview
Border tokens are crucial in defining the boundaries and structure of UI elements. They play a significant role in guiding user interaction and enhancing the clarity of the interface.

### Purpose
- Establishing consistent and reusable border styles throughout the application.
- Enhancing user understanding of the interface by clearly defining where a design begins and ends.

### Design Token Implementation
- **Border Width**: Standardize border widths to maintain consistency across UI components.
- **Border Style**: Define styles such as solid, dotted, or dashed to suit different design needs.
- **Border Color**: Align border colors with the overall color scheme of the design system.

### Application in UI Design
- Use border tokens to define the edges of buttons, input fields, cards, and other components.
- Employ borders to visually separate different sections of the UI or to highlight interactive elements.

By implementing these border token guidelines, we ensure that our UI components are consistent, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing, contributing to a cohesive and user-friendly experience.


## Axios Instance for API Calls
- **Usage**: Use Axios for efficient HTTP requests to backend services.
- **Configuration**: Centralize Axios configuration in `axiosInstance.js` for consistent API interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API responses.
- **Interceptors**: Utilize Axios interceptors for global request/response processing.
- **Customization**: Tailor Axios instance to fit specific project needs, including headers and timeouts.
