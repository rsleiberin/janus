# Utilities Best Practices

## Design Tokens
- **Buttons**: Ensure easy interaction with appropriately sized buttons. Use contrasting colors for primary and secondary actions, and maintain shape consistency.
- **Colors**: Focus on an achromatic palette, highlighting colorful AI-generated content. Ensure readability and accessibility through sufficient contrast.
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that align with the minimalist theme and implement scalable sizing for legibility.
- **Spacing**: Use a 4-point grid system for consistency and precision.

## Animations
- **3D Motion Graphics**: Create engaging and interactive experiences with realistic 3D animations.
- **Hover Effects**: Enhance UI interactivity with hover animations.
- **Morphing**: Use morphing effects for artistic transitions.
- **Anthropomorphic Animations**: Incorporate human-like animations for immersive experiences.
- **Kinetic Typography**: Captivate attention with moving text animations.

## Icons
- **Simplicity**: Keep icons simple and recognizable.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a cohesive visual style across all icons.
- **Clarity**: Ensure icons are unambiguous and clearly convey their purpose.
- **Scalability**: Design icons to be scalable across different sizes.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Establish clear hierarchy in icon design.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Ensure appropriate usage context for icons.

## Responsive Design
- **Device Adaptability**: Design should adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Relative Length Units**: Use scalable units for layout elements.
- **Layout Considerations**: Implement flexible grids and logical structures.
- **Navigation Adaptability**: Tailor navigation for different devices.
- **Responsive Images**: Ensure images scale with layout changes.
- **Text Readability**: Maintain legible text across devices.

## Axios Instance for API Calls
- **Usage**: Use Axios for efficient HTTP requests to backend services.
- **Configuration**: Centralize Axios configuration in `axiosInstance.js` for consistent API interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API responses.
- **Interceptors**: Utilize Axios interceptors for global request/response processing.
- **Customization**: Tailor Axios instance to fit specific project needs, including headers and timeouts.
