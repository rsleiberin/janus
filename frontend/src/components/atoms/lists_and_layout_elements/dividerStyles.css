.divider {
    border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.12); /* Using the black color token with 12% opacity */
    margin: 16px 0; /* Based on the medium spacing token */
  }
  
  /* Notes:
  - The thickness and color of the divider can be adjusted as per design requirements.
  - The margin ensures appropriate spacing around the divider, enhancing visual separation.
  - For darker themes, change the border color to a lighter shade for better visibility.
