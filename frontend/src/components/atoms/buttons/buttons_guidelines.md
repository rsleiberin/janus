## IconButton Research Summary

### Understanding IconButton
- An icon button is a button that contains only an icon, often used in various user interfaces.

### Accessible Button Design
- Utilize `<button>` or `role="button"` for screen reader recognition.
- Ensure keyboard interactivity with `ENTER` and `SPACE` keys.

### Techniques for Accessible Names
1. **Accessible Visually Hidden Text**: Use CSS to hide text while keeping it accessible to screen readers.
2. **Hidden Attribute with `aria-labelledby`**: Hide text using the `hidden` attribute.
3. **Using `aria-label`**: Directly provide an accessible label with `aria-label`.
4. **`aria-label` on SVG Icon**: Use the icon to create an accessible label.
5. **`aria-labelledby` on SVG Icon**: A method to make inline SVG images accessible.

### SVG for Icons
- Prefer SVG over icon fonts for scalability, flexibility, and better accessibility.

These guidelines focus on creating accessible and user-friendly IconButton components, leveraging modern web practices and emphasizing universal design principles.

## Floating Action Button (FAB) Research Summary

### Size and Usage
- Two sizes: Default (56x56 dp) and Mini (40x40 dp).
