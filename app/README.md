# Blueprints Directory - Modular Components of Janus Flask Project

## Introduction
The `blueprints` directory is structured to modularize the Janus Flask application using the Flask Blueprints feature. This approach allows for the separation of different aspects of the application into individual modules for organization and manageability.

## Directories
- [design](./design): Blueprint for the design aspect of the Janus Flask project.
- [art](./art): Blueprint dedicated to the art domain of the Janus Flask project.
- [philosophy](./philosophy): Blueprint for the philosophy facet of the Janus Flask project.

## Task
To maintain and enhance the modularity, ensure that each blueprint has its `routes.py` file and other necessary configurations within their respective directories.
