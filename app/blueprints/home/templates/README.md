# Templates Directory - Home Blueprint

## Introduction
This directory contains the HTML templates for the `home` blueprint. These templates define the structure and layout of the website's homepage and include reusable UI components following atomic design principles.

## Contents
- `base.html`: The base template includes the essential structure and elements common across the website's pages, such as header and footer.
- `index.html`: The homepage template that incorporates various UI components to provide the main landing page of the site.

## Atomic Design Structure
- `atoms/`: The smallest UI components, analogous to HTML elements like buttons and inputs.
- `molecules/`: Combinations of atoms that form more complex UI elements such as search bars, card elements, etc.
- `organisms/`: Groups of molecules that establish significant portions of the interface, like navigation bars or footer sections.

## Notes
- Atomic design principles ensure modular, maintainable, and scalable UI development.
- The templates should be developed adhering to best UI/UX practices for accessibility and responsiveness.
- The contents of this directory should be updated in this README as the project progresses.
