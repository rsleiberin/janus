# Molecules Subdirectory - Home Blueprint Templates

## Introduction
The `molecules` subdirectory within the `templates` directory of the `home` blueprint evolves atomic components into more complex, reusable UI constructs.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Assembling and refining multiple atomic elements into functional molecular components.
- [ ] Establish and catalog an essential set of molecules to bolster the UI's functionality and coherence.

## Files
- `navbar.html`: A composite navigation element, integrating multiple atoms for cohesive functionality. (Status: Placeholder)
- `form.html`: A structure that unifies various input atoms into a coherent form module. (Status: Placeholder)
- Additional molecular components will be documented as they are developed.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Molecules are intended to fulfill distinct roles within the UI.
- Flexibility and ease of integration into broader UI contexts are priorities.
- Design adherence to the established design system is imperative for visual harmony.

## Notes
- Molecules serve an intermediary function, linking simplistic atoms and complex organisms in the design hierarchy.
- The README should be regularly updated to reflect the state of molecular component development.
