# Atoms Subdirectory - Home Blueprint Templates

## Introduction
The `atoms` subdirectory within the `templates` directory of the `home` blueprint adheres to atomic design methodology, containing the smallest, reusable UI components.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Crafting and tuning fine-grained UI components known as atoms.
- [ ] Develop and maintain a comprehensive set of atoms for reusability across the application.

## Files
- `button.html`: A standard button element for universal application. (Status: Placeholder)
- `input.html`: A basic input field designed for form element consistency. (Status: Placeholder)
- More atomic components will be added and listed here as developed.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Atoms should epitomize simplicity and reusability.
- Documentation of each atom is crucial for communicating its intended use.
- Adherence to coding standards and naming conventions is expected for project-wide consistency.

## Notes
- Atomic components are the foundational building blocks for larger UI constructs.
- Timely updates to this README are essential to accurately represent the current scope of atomic components.
