# Templates Directory - Home Blueprint of Janus Flask Project

## Introduction
The `templates` directory is part of the `home` blueprint within the Janus project. It houses all the HTML template files that are used for rendering views specific to the home section of the application. Following the atomic design methodology, this directory is structured to support a modular and reusable approach to UI components.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Creation and structuring of atomic design sub-directories.
- [ ] Populate and refine the templates within each sub-directory.
- [ ] Ensure that all templates meet accessibility and responsive design standards.
- [ ] Completion of the templates directory is pending the finalization of all sub-directories.

## Files
- `PENDING`: The root of the `templates` directory will only contain sub-directories and this README. All HTML files are to be organized within the appropriate sub-directory.

## Directories
- `In Progress`: [atoms](./atoms) - The fundamental HTML elements like buttons, inputs, etc.
- `In Progress`: [molecules](./molecules) - Groups of atoms fused together to function as a unit.
- `In Progress`: [organisms](./organisms) - Complex UI components made up of molecules and possibly atoms.
- `In Progress`: [templates](./templates) - The layout templates that form the structural basis of our pages.
- `In Progress`: [pages](./pages) - The complete pages constructed from the organisms, molecules, and atoms.

## Notes
- This structure is designed to keep our UI components organized and maintainable.
- It is essential to adhere to the naming conventions and organizational standards outlined in each sub-directory's README for consistency.
- Utilization of Tailwind CSS ensures a scalable and maintainable stylesheet architecture, complementing our component-based design approach.
