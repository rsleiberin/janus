# Templates Directory - Janus Home Blueprint

## Introduction
The `templates` directory contains all the HTML template files used for rendering views in the `home` blueprint of the Janus Flask application. We follow the atomic design principles, allowing for modular and reusable components.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Set up the foundational templates for the `home` blueprint.
- [ ] Segment the templates based on atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages).
  
## Files
- `index.html`: The main landing page for the Janus Flask application.

## Directories
- `PENDING`: Sub-directories for various atomic components will be created here.

## Notes
- We're utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across all templates.
- Remember to keep modularity in mind, allowing for efficient and consistent development.
