# Molecules Subdirectory - Home Blueprint Templates

## Introduction
The `molecules` subdirectory within the `templates` directory of the `home` blueprint focuses on combining atoms into more complex and reusable components, following the atomic design principles.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Assembling and refining molecular components.
- [ ] Establish a comprehensive set of molecules that enhance the UI's functionality and consistency.

## Files
- `In Progress`: `navbar.html` - Navigation bar element, integrating multiple atomic components.
- `In Progress`: `form.html` - Form structures that bring together various input atoms.
- `In Progress`: More molecular components will be listed here as they are developed.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Molecules should embody clear, functional purposes within the UI.
- Ensure that molecules are flexible and easily integrated into larger organizational structures.
- Adhere to the project's design system and standards for a cohesive look and feel.

## Notes
- Molecules are pivotal in bridging the gap between the basic building blocks (atoms) and the more complex UI components (organisms).
- Regularly update the README to reflect the current state and modifications of molecular components.
