# Atoms Subdirectory - Home Blueprint Templates

## Introduction
The `atoms` subdirectory within the `templates` directory of the `home` blueprint is dedicated to the atomic design methodology, housing the smallest reusable components of the UI.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Creating and refining atomic components.
- [ ] Develop a robust set of atomic elements that can be reused throughout the application.

## Files
- `In Progress`: `button.html` - Standard button element for universal use.
- `In Progress`: `input.html` - Input field designed for form consistency.
- `PENDING`: Additional atomic components to be detailed here as they are developed.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Maintain simplicity and reusability in atomic design elements.
- Ensure all atoms are documented for clarity on usage.
- Follow the project's coding and naming conventions for consistency.

## Notes
- Atomic components should be designed with modularity and integration in mind, anticipating their combination into more complex molecules and organisms.
- Update the README timely to reflect the addition or modification of atomic elements.
