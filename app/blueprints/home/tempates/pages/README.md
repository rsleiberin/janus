# Pages Subdirectory - Home Blueprint Templates

## Introduction
The `pages` subdirectory within the `templates` directory of the `home` blueprint contains the page-level templates that serve as the final view rendered to the user, integrating atoms, molecules, and organisms into complete layouts following the atomic design structure.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Development of page-level templates for a coherent user experience.
- [ ] Ensure all page templates are responsive and adhere to the predetermined design system.

## Files
- `In Progress`: `index.html` - The primary landing page template of the Janus project's home blueprint.
- `In Progress`: Additional page templates will be added here as they are developed.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Page templates should be comprehensive, representing the final rendered page seen by users.
- Utilize the established atomic design hierarchy, incorporating atoms, molecules, and organisms.
- Confirm that all templates are fully responsive and tested across various devices and screen sizes.

## Notes
- Page templates are the culmination of the atomic design process, where smaller components are combined to form the entire page.
- Remember to periodically update this README to reflect the latest state of page development within the `home` blueprint.
