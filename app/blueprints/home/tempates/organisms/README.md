# Organisms Subdirectory - Home Blueprint Templates

## Introduction
The `organisms` subdirectory within the `templates` directory of the `home` blueprint is dedicated to the construction of complex UI components that form distinct sections of the webpage, adhering to atomic design methodologies.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Development and refinement of organism components.
- [ ] Compose a robust set of organisms to construct key interfaces within the `home` blueprint.

## Files
- `In Progress`: `header.html` - The top-level navigation and branding component for the homepage.
- `In Progress`: `footer.html` - The footer component, containing links and copyright information.
- `In Progress`: `hero_section.html` - A compelling full-width section, often including an image and a call to action.
- `In Progress`: Additional organisms will be documented here as they are crafted.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Organisms should represent sections of a page, which can be reused across different views.
- Design organisms to be self-contained and independently portable to other areas of the application.
- Maintain a consistent style with the use of Tailwind CSS classes and adhere to the design system.

## Notes
- Organisms combine multiple molecules into complex sections of the interface, laying the groundwork for page templates.
- Ensure that updates to the README coincide with the progression and evolution of the organisms' development.
