# `blueprints` Directory - Modular Structure of Janus Flask Project

## Introduction
The `blueprints` directory implements the concept of "Blueprints" from the Flask framework, enabling a modular and extensible architecture for the Janus project. Blueprints allow us to organize our application into distinct components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the portfolio website.

## Status
The blueprints directory setup is progressing, and foundational blueprints are being initialized. Work has begun on the `home` and `design` blueprints, while others are in the planning phase.

## Blueprint Breakdown
Each Blueprint serves a different section of the portfolio and has its own set of routes, view functions, and templates. Here's the current structure:

- `home`: The Blueprint for the main landing page. (Status: In Progress)
- `design`: Manages the design portfolio, displaying digital, physical, service, and research offerings. (Status: In Progress)
- `art`: Will showcase the art portfolio, including audio, visual, narrative, and multimedia creations. (Status: Pending)
- `philosophy`: Dedicated to exploring philosophical musings, including the website's mission, ethics, methodology, and interaction design principles. (Status: Pending)

## To-Do
- Finalize `home` and `design` blueprints, building out routes and templates.
- Begin development on `art` and `philosophy` blueprints.
- Integrate blueprint-specific databases, utilities, and tooling.
- Ensure cohesive integration with Flask app's `__init__.py`.

## Files and Directories
- `__init__.py`: Registration file for linking individual blueprints with the main application. (Status: Pending)
- `[design]`: Blueprint for the design-related content; defines related routes and views. (Status: In Progress)
- `[art]`: Blueprint for art-related content; will host a variety of artistic expressions. (Status: Pending)
- `[philosophy]`: Blueprint outlining the project's philosophy; serves as a platform for deeper narratives. (Status: Pending)
