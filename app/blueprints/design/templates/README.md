# Templates for Design - Janus Flask Project

## Introduction
The `templates` directory under `design` is intended for holding all the HTML templates required for rendering the design portfolio items and their related content.

## Status
- `In Progress`: Initialize templates for the design portfolio.
- [ ] Develop responsive templates for various design categories.
- [ ] Implement template inheritance for reusability.
- [ ] Integrate Tailwind CSS styles to maintain a consistent design language.

## Files & Descriptions
- `PENDING`: `base.html` - The foundational template from which other templates will inherit common elements.
- `PENDING`: `index.html` - The main landing template for the design portfolio.
- `PENDING`: Individual templates for each category: `digital.html`, `physical.html`, `service.html`, `research.html`, and their respective sub-categories.

## Utility
Templates play a pivotal role in Flask web applications, allowing for dynamic rendering of content based on user interactions and database records. This directory will evolve to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience to visitors exploring the design works on Janus.

## Collaboration
For collaboration on templates, ensure consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes and maintain the overall design language set for Janus. Ensure that templates are modular and leverage the power of Jinja2 template inheritance.
