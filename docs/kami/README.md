# Janus - The Central Project Kami

Welcome to the central documentation for Janus, the leading Kami within our digital ecosystem. Janus operates as the primary interface between the user and the array of specialized sub-agents, orchestrating the collective effort to create a cohesive digital presence.

## Central Controller

Janus's role is to seamlessly connect the user's intentions with the functionalities provided by a diverse group of sub-agents. It acts as a conductor, interpreting user needs and translating them into specific tasks that are then delegated to the appropriate agents.

## Task Delegation

The sub-agents, categorized as either molecules or atoms, are specialized entities designed to perform distinct roles within the system. Janus maintains an overarching context, dictating the "what" while the sub-agents focus on the "how."

## Documentation Purpose

This documentation serves multiple purposes:

- **Describing Functionalities**: It outlines the capabilities and responsibilities of Janus and its sub-agents.
- **Guiding Users**: It provides insight into how users should interact with Janus and what to expect in terms of responsiveness and customization.
- **Facilitating Development**: It serves as a knowledge base for developers, containing the operational guidelines and protocols that govern the behavior of Janus and its sub-agents.

## Structure

Each sub-agent within Janus's command will have its dedicated section within this documentation, providing detailed descriptions of their tasks, workflows, and how they contribute to the overall objectives of the project.

As Janus evolves, so too will this documentation, ensuring that it remains an accurate and up-to-date resource that reflects the dynamic nature of our digital ecosystem.
