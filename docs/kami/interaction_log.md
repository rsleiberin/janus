# Interaction Log

This log records all interactions between agents within the system, including data hand-offs, permission changes, and error reporting. It serves as an audit trail for system administrators and developers to monitor the system's health and troubleshoot issues.

## Log Format

Each entry in the interaction log should include the following information:

- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the interaction occurred.
- **Agents Involved**: The names of the agent or agents involved in the interaction.
- **Interaction Type**: The type of interaction (e.g., data hand-off, permission granted/revoked, error).
- **Details**: A description of the interaction, including any relevant file names, data formats, or error messages.
- **Status**: The result of the interaction (e.g., successful, failed, pending intervention).

## Error Reporting

- **Error Code**: If applicable, the error code associated with the issue.
- **Error Description**: A clear description of the error and its impact on the system.
- **Recovery Steps**: Any steps taken to address the error or instructions for further action.
