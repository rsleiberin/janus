### Specialist Instruction for Detailed Design Token Research and Documentation

Dear Specialist,

Please proceed with the next phase of your task involving a deep dive into a broad range of design resources to curate a nuanced and complete library of design token categories. This library should cover, not exhaustively, but substantially, the range of options available in modern web UI/UX design to aid in the dynamic creation of user-driven websites.

**Your objectives include:**
- Broadening your research scope to include a diverse range of design systems.
- Compiling a taxonomy of design token categories.
- Documenting your findings with clarity, organization, and visual support.
- Engaging in iterative feedback to refine the design system.
- Aligning the token framework with Flask, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for grounded applicability.

Please confirm once you have initiated this phase and inform me periodically of your progress.

Best Regards,
Project Strategist
