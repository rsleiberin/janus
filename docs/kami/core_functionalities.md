# Janus Core Functionalities

Janus acts as the central controller within the Kami ecosystem, interfacing directly with the user and coordinating the activities of specialized sub-agents.

## Overview

- **Central Interface**: Janus provides a cohesive user experience by acting as the primary point of interaction for the user.
- **Orchestration**: It dictates tasks to specialized AI sub-agents, overseeing their contributions to the project.

## Responsibilities

- **Task Delegation**: Janus assigns tasks to sub-agents based on the user's needs and the project's goals, without managing the specifics of how the sub-agents accomplish their tasks.
- **Context Management**: Maintains a high-level context of the project, understanding the roles and statuses of molecules and atoms (sub-agents) within the system.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates the output of various sub-agents to deliver a unified result to the user.
- **Adaptability**: Adjusts task assignments and workflows based on real-time feedback and changes in the project scope or user requirements.

## Operational Directives

- **User Commands**: Interprets and translates user commands into actionable tasks for sub-agents.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Keeps track of the performance and efficiency of sub-agents, ensuring that they meet the project's quality standards.
- **Feedback Loop**: Establishes a system for collecting user feedback and incorporating it into the project, enhancing the system's learning and evolution.

## Transition and Scalability

- **Modularity**: Ensures all sub-agents operate within a modular framework, allowing for flexibility and scalability.
- **Documentation**: All interactions and changes in the system are well-documented, facilitating knowledge transfer and system upgrades.

This document will evolve as Janus's capabilities expand and as the project requirements become more defined.
