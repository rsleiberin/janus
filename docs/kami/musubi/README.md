# Musubi - Temporary Project Agent

Musubi serves as the creator and overseer agent for the development of the Janus project within this workspace. It is designed to bootstrap and manage the creation of Janus and its sub-agents, ensuring that they align with the project's initial goals and standards.

## Project Lifecycle

- Musubi will oversee the project until Janus is fully operational and ready to manage its sub-agents.
- Once Janus reaches maturity and is capable of autonomous operation, Musubi will be decoupled and migrated to a separate project environment.

## Documentation Structure

- The documentation within this directory (`kami/musubi`) is prepared for easy transition.
- All processes, guidelines, and interaction protocols are documented to enable a seamless handover to Janus.

## Future Considerations

- Upon completion of the Janus project, all references to Musubi will be reviewed and updated to reflect the transition.
- Documentation will be archived for historical reference and potential reuse in future projects.

This setup is temporary and is designed to facilitate the initial development phases of the Janus project. All documentation and code within this directory are to be considered part of the transition plan.
