# Image Processing Directory

## Overview
This directory is part of the exploratory phase of the design system, focusing on research and prototyping image processing techniques for clustering, visualizing, and deriving information from images. The insights gathered here are foundational to the design system and its components.

## Why This Project Matters
This project bridges the gap between exploratory image processing and real-world applications:
1. **Research Insight**:
   - Uncover patterns in color and spatial data that inform design.
2. **Scalability**:
   - A robust pipeline ensures that as the project grows, it can handle complex data and integrate new features with ease.
3. **Foundation for UI Design**:
   - The insights gained here are directly applied to building components for the design system.

## Goals

### Current Goals
1. Extract detailed data from images, including LAB, RGB, spatial, and metadata.
2. Perform clustering analysis using LAB and spatial data.
3. Analyze clustering results to inform luminosity layers for UI design.
4. Generate visualizations to validate data processing and clustering methods.

### Future Goals
1. Integrate alpha channel processing to support transparency-based designs.
2. Prepare for server-side API integration to scale image processing operations.
3. Enable neural network integration for advanced pattern recognition and dataset training.

## Walkthrough of the Process

### Preprocessing
1. **Load Image Data**: Validate input images and extract metadata (dimensions, format, etc.).
2. **Pixel Extraction**: Convert sRGB to LAB color space and extract LAB, RGB, and spatial data.
3. **Alpha Placeholder**: Reserve space for alpha data in future expansions.
4. **Database Integration**: Prepare the SQLite schema to store extracted data.

### Analysis
1. Perform DBSCAN clustering using LAB and spatial data.
2. Detect edges and shapes for additional analysis.
3. Generate histograms to study global and regional color distributions.

### Visualization
1. Visualize clusters and shapes to validate clustering results.
2. Overlay luminosity layers and shapes for UI design analysis.

### Server Integration
1. APIs for uploading and processing images.
2. Queries for accessing processed results.

2. **Neural Network Integration**:
   - Use clustered data as a training dataset for pattern recognition.
   - Expand clustering results with descriptive outputs using LLMs.
3. **Scaling**:
   - Shift to a scalable database like PostgreSQL or cloud-hosted solutions.
   - Optimize clustering and analysis for larger datasets.
