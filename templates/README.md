# Templates Directory

## Introduction
The `templates` directory is reserved for Flask's Jinja2 templates. As the project is integrating a Next.js frontend, these templates will mainly define the structure for backend-specific views or components that aren't managed by Next.js. This ensures a seamless user experience between the backend-rendered content and the frontend application.

## Status
- `Currently Empty`

## Tasks
- [ ] Populate with Jinja2 templates as the project evolves, ensuring compatibility with the Next.js frontend.
- [ ] Review templates for responsiveness and accessibility, ensuring a consistent look and feel with the rest of the frontend.
- [ ] Consider opportunities for template components to be reusable, aligning with the atomic design principles adopted for the frontend.

## Files
- As of now, this directory does not contain any files.

## Directories
- There are no sub-directories in the `templates` directory. However, as the project grows, consider organizing templates based on their purpose or the routes they correspond to.
