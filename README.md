# Project Janus - Next.js Web Application

## Introduction
Over time, this project became about personal empowerment. I started coding by just asking the agent to do all of it for me and working through everything while I taught myself more advanced concepts and tried to understand workflow. My problem was that I needed a design system, so now I'm working on that and getting my portfolio up with the research.

### Research:
The files found in /image_processing are research programs designed to define a mathematically researched basis on human perception so that autonomous agents have a framework for generating content for users and have the means to adapt to the large array of multi-style rich media.
