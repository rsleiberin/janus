# Models Directory

## Introduction
The `models` directory plays a fundamental role in the Janus Flask Project, designed to host the database models that will power the backend. As you embark on establishing an AGI open-source company with a strong digital presence, these models will define and maintain the integrity of your data. They capture the relationships and structures between various entities, from user profiles to the diverse styles and themes of the content you produce.

## Status
- `PENDING`

## Tasks
- [ ] Define primary data structures essential to the project:
    - `User`: For managing user information, preferences, and interactions.
    - `Project`: To encapsulate details of each creative or technical endeavor.
    - `Style`: Capturing metadata about the different visual and thematic styles presented.
    - `Interaction`: Track user interactions to refine UX and content presentation.
- [ ] Establish relationships between models, understanding the intricate web of connections between users, their preferences, the projects they interact with, and the styles they resonate with. Relationships like one-to-many or many-to-many should be methodically determined.
- [ ] Ensure each model has adequate validation and security measures, especially when handling user data.

## Files
- `PENDING`: The directory is poised for growth. As you flesh out your data requirements, each model will be given its dedicated file, ensuring clarity and modularity.

## Note
When conceptualizing the models, it's pivotal to align them with the project's vision. Strive for clarity, security, and scalability, knowing that well-designed models will lay a robust foundation for the Janus Flask Project's success.
